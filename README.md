This repository contains a practical exercise where we apply concepts learned in handling Node.js, Express, and Pug templates. Below are the key aspects of the exercise:

## Main Feature:

**Rendering Views with Pug:** üê∂

- Views are rendered using the Pug template engine.

## Highlighted Features:

1. **Separate Modules:**

   - A modular approach is employed to organize and structure the code, following good development practices.

2. **Basic Route with Express:**

   - A basic route with Express is created to serve a classic web page with sections such as Home, Who We Are?, Where Are We?, What We Do?, Contact, etc.

3. **Endpoint Handling:**

   - The route (endpoint) responds with the corresponding view, applying the concepts seen with the use of Pug templates.

4. **Use of Public Folder for Static Files:**

   - The `public` folder is used to serve static files, allowing the client to access resources in the `css`, `img`, and `js` folders to style and add effects to the interface.

5. **Passing Variables to Pug Template:**

   - Variable passing to the Pug template is tested to achieve rendering of different views using a single template.

6. **Application Start with `npm start`:** ‚úÖ
   - The application is started using the `npm start` command, following common conventions for starting Node.js applications.
